# Talking with an image

This project demonstrates how to interact with an image using Google's Gemini Pro Vision model. It allows users to upload an image and then ask questions about its content, receiving descriptive text responses generated by the AI.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd py-talk-image
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    The [main.ipynb](main.ipynb) notebook installs these, but you can also install them manually:
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv pillow -q
    ```

4.  **Set up your Google API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Google API Key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *(Note: The `.env` file is ignored by Git as specified in [.gitignore](.gitignore).)*

## Usage

1.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open [main.ipynb](main.ipynb).

2.  **Run the cells:**
    Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
    *   The first few cells will install dependencies and configure the `genai` library.
    *   A cell will prompt you to "Enter image path:". Provide the path to an image file you want to analyze.
    *   The notebook will then list available Gemini models.
    *   Finally, a conversational loop will start, prompting you to "Ask something:".

3.  **Interact with the image:**
    Type your questions about the image. The `gemini-2.5-flash` model will generate a textual response based on the image content and your prompt.

    Example interaction:
    ```
    Ask something: What is in this image?
    ```

4.  **Exit the conversation:**
    To stop the conversation, type `exit`, `bye`, or `quit` when prompted.

## Dependencies

*   [`google-generativeai`](main.ipynb)
*   [`python-dotenv`](main.ipynb)
*   [`Pillow`](main.ipynb)
